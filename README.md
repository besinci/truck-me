track expenses of my bike.


For a long time, I was using an app for tracking the expenses of my motorcycle. After a while, the ads in the app started getting annoying and the app is was not that good at showing reports(last month, last 3 months, etc.) so in the end, I chose to make my own app. 

I'm going to start writing the API and figured out the rest.
I don't have any experience in mobile development so I hope it is going to be a good journey for me.
The main idea is to create the app I need, but I will also use this repository as a playground to learn new technologies.
